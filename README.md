# Coupled U-Nets

### Description
This is a Keras implementation of [Coupled U-Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06521) model proposed by Z. Tang et al. for UNINA Computer Science's course "Computer Vision".
Model can be found in `models.py`. 

It has been trained on [MPII Dataset]("http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/") for Human Pose Estimation task.

Training was performed on the following model by making some variations at the architecture level and at the optimizer parameter level. 

Data were collected in csv files to produce charts that were used for the course examination.
